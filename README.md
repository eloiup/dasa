# dasa case study data scientist

This repository is an attempted solution to the dasa case study for data scientist.

It does not follow the guidelines 100%. (I apologize for that)

It has two main directories; data and notebooks.

Data contains the original datasets as well as a manufactured data set.

Notebooks contain four different ipynb files. (standard libraries from anaconda python 3.6 as well as lightgbm)

(didnt create a requirements file as well - sorry)

The notebooks directory contains these files:

1. EDA
2. FE
3. Model Evaluation
4. Eval Results

They should be seem in that order.
Eval results can be run (given a path is provided) to evaluate the model on a test set.

Other notebooks are well commented and should be self explanatory.

Further improvement opportunities would be:

- Feature Selection
- Outlier removal for trainning
- Further feature engineering
- Gather more data about events (ideally patient & doctor meta information)

Any doubts or suggestions
